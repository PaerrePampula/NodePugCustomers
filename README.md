# NodePugCustomers

An example application demonstrating a nodejs server with a pug engine

It simply allows the client to save info about imaginary customers (firstname, lastname, phone and email). The saving is done on 
 
 the node client itself, so the info will only be saved during the runtime of the program.

The "database" infact is simply a javascript array of some preset info and added info
# How does it work?

This runs on node js so the first requirement is to install npm and node js

Secondly, you will need the express library to run a web framework on the nodejs service

Then you will also need to install pug and body-parser as well

Pug is the templating engine, and body-parser is used to read params from forms of the user.

Once the requirements are met, run "npm run start", or "npm run dev" if you have nodemon installed.
